# In our project we consider the collusion game known from industrial organization/game theory courses. The firms compete over quantities i.e. Ã¡la Cournot.$^1$ We start by finding the profit in the Cournot case. After, we find each firms collusion profits and lastly we look at the optimal deviation from collusion and the profits that follows. In our model demand is charaterized by the inverse demand function: 
# $$P=max\{a - b \cdot Q ,0\} $$
# Firms are assumed to have constant marginal cost and the total cost for each firm is as follows:
# $$TC = c \cdot q_i$$
# We assume that $a-c>0$ such that the firm produces a positive quantity. Before finding the Cournot profit, we define our variables.
# 
# 1: Alternatively, one could think of the competition as being over prices with capacity constraints which yield the Cornout output.

# We get the $SPNE = \{Cournot, Cournot\}$. In other words, the cartel stability game is a prisoners dilemma and the players end up in the paretodominated scenario. 
#%% [markdown]
# ## Infinetely repeated game
#%% [markdown]
# In most real world apliccations cartels do not just meet once, but instead multiple times where the firms in each period decide to either collude or compete. Then each period can be thought of as a new prisoners dilemma. If time is assumed to be infinite, we have infinitely many periods and the game is repeated infinitely many times (G($\infty$)).$^1$ If this is the case let us consider the grim trigger strategy which is defined as:
# 
# $s_{1,2}$: *In the first period play "Cartel". In every other period play* "Cartel" *if* "Cartel" *is played by 
# the other firm in all previous periods. If* "Cartel" *is not played in every previous period play* "No Cartel".
# 
# We note that playing "No Cartel" is a Nash equilibrium and therefore a credible threat. Furthermore, we see that both firms can get a higher pay-off from deviating in the current period. However, the deviating firm will then get punished in all future periods. Therefore, there must exist a value of how much the firms have to value future profit compared to profit gained today in order not to deviate. Let us call this value $\delta$. $\delta$ is found by solving the equation below. 
# 
# $$\sum^{\infty}_{i=0} \delta^t \cdot \pi^{Col} \geq \pi^{dev} + \sum^{\infty}_{i=1} \delta^t \cdot \pi^{Cour} \Leftrightarrow$$
# $$\frac{1}{1-\delta} \cdot \pi^{Col} \geq \pi^{dev} + \frac{\delta}{1-\delta} \cdot \pi^{Cour} $$
# 
# 1: A more realistic and intuitive way to think of the infinite game is a game that is being played over and over, but might not be infinite. However, it is played so many times that the last times it is being played do not matter for the outcome in the current period. In that way the game might not be objectively infinite, but it is infinite in the minds of the players. Alternatively, the players do not know whether this is the last time the game is being played. They play the game believing that it is not the last round, while it actually could be the last round, but they behave as they will meet again.

Delta can be interpreted as how much the firms value profits gained tomorrow compared to those gained today and in that sense, the firms have to value profits gained tommorow {round(delta[0],2)} as much as profits gained today in order to sustain collusion.')

# We see that it is no coincidence that we ended up with delta value of 0.53 before.

# In the one-shot game firms will not form a cartel. However, in a repeated game the incentive to form a cartel increases as the profits tommorow depend on the action today. If the firms are patient enough, it is possible to sustain a cartel.
