Dear professors, teachers and fellow students.

The aim with this project, is to create an economic model that describes the industry structure where two companies compete agaist each other. We will do this by using Cournot competition theory, which is known from Industrial Organization and Game Theory e.g. from the Microeconomics 3 course.

We apply the model of Cournot competion describing two companies competing in quantities. They decide the level of production independently of each other and at the same time. 

After findig the cournot production level and profits, we investigate how collusion and deviation from a collusion will impact on the these factors. 

The code is written in Python 3 by using Jupyter lab. In the code, we will take the reader in hand - step by step.  
Note that we use the package nashpy (if you have not already installed the package, it is done by typing pip install nashpy in your Anacondat Prompt or terminal + enter)

Happy reading :)

Yours Sincerely

Mr. tfw707, Mr. hkb519, Mr. xnv591
