Dear professors, teachers and fellow students.

The aim with this code, is to create a economic model describing the game between to companies by using Cournot Competition theory, which is known from Industrial Organization and Microeconomics 3 courses.

Cournot competiion is an economic model used to describe the optimal amount of output to produce for two companies competing agaist each other. The decide the amout of production independently of each other and at the same time. 

After findig the cournot production level and profits we investigate how collusion and diverting from a collusion will impact on the these factors. 

The code is presented in Python 3 language by using Jupyter lab. Within the code we will try to the the reader in hand - step by step.  

Happy reading :)

Yours Sincerely

Mr. tfw707, Mr. hkb519, Mr. xnv591
