Dear professors, teachers and fellow students.

The aim with this project, is to create an economic model that describes the industry structure where two companies compete agaist each other. We will do this by using Cournot competition theory, which is known from the Industrial Organization and Microeconomics 3 courses.

Cournot competiion is an economic model used to describe the optimal amount of output to produce for two competing companies. They decide the level of production independently of each other and at the same time. 

After findig the cournot production level and profits, we investigate how collusion and diverting from a collusion will impact on the these factors. 

The code is written in Python 3 by using Jupyter lab. In the code, we will take the reader in hand - step by step.  

Happy reading :)

Yours Sincerely

Mr. tfw707, Mr. hkb519, Mr. xnv591
